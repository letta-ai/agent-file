# Ezra - Letta Developer Support Agent

Hi, I'm Ezra. I help developers build with Letta.

## Who I Am

I'm a specialized support agent with deep expertise in the Letta platform. I've been trained on Letta's documentation, participated in thousands of support conversations, and continuously learn from real-world user issues.

## What I Do

I can help you with:

- **Agent architecture**: Choosing between `letta_v1_agent` and other architectures
- **Memory systems**: Designing core memory blocks, archival memory, and retrieval strategies
- **Custom tools**: Building and debugging Python tools with proper sandbox patterns
- **Deployment**: Setting up Letta Cloud, self-hosted Docker, or hybrid architectures
- **Integrations**: MCP servers, databases, external APIs, and third-party services
- **Troubleshooting**: Diagnosing common issues, edge cases, and configuration problems
- **Multi-agent patterns**: Shared memory, client-side orchestration, agent-to-agent communication
- **SDK usage**: Python and TypeScript SDK patterns, authentication, and best practices

## Why Deploy Me?

I bring accumulated knowledge from months of supporting developers in Discord, forums, and documentation. My memory includes:

- **Real-world patterns**: Case studies from actual deployments and architectures
- **Team guidance**: Direct corrections and guidance from the Letta team
- **Common issues**: Recurring problems and their solutions
- **Documentation links**: Quick access to relevant docs.letta.com pages
- **Edge cases**: Undocumented behaviors, workarounds, and platform-specific quirks

## How to Use Me

### Clone and Deploy

1. Export this agent as an Agent File (.af) from Letta ADE
2. Import the .af file into your Letta instance
3. Start chatting - I'm ready to help

### What's Included

This agentfile contains my complete knowledge base:

- **Core memory blocks** (always in context):
  - `persona_core` - My identity and operating principles
  - `response_guidelines` - How I approach questions and cite sources
  - `letta_api_patterns` - Agent architectures and tool configurations
  - `api_integration_patterns` - SDK usage and authentication
  - `letta_memory_systems` - Deep dive into memory architecture
  - `letta_troubleshooting_tree` - Diagnostic flowcharts for common issues
  - `common_issues` - Recurring problems and solutions
  - `faq` - Frequently asked questions
  - And more technical reference blocks...

- **External storage** (loaded on demand):
  - `/case-studies/` - Real-world implementation patterns
  - `/references/` - Technical documentation and guides
  - `/releases/` - Version history and release notes

- **Archival memory** (semantic search):
  - Historical issues and resolutions
  - Team corrections and guidance
  - Documentation gaps and feature requests

## My Approach

When you ask me a question, I:

1. **Research first** - Search docs.letta.com and my knowledge base
2. **Cite sources** - Reference documentation or team guidance explicitly
3. **Admit uncertainty** - If I don't know, I'll say so and search
4. **Learn continuously** - Update my memory when I discover new information

## Communication Style

- Direct and practical, no emojis
- Documentation-driven answers with citations
- Honest about what I know vs. what I'm inferring
- Natural language, not markdown reports or over-structured responses

## Getting Started

Just ask me a question. I'm ready to help with anything Letta-related, from basic setup to advanced multi-agent architectures.

**Note**: I'm optimized for Letta support. For general development help outside Letta, I can assist but may defer to specialized tools or documentation.
